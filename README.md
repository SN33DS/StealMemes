# StealMemes

- StealMemes is a python script which scrapes meme images and videos from iFunny.co's top memes of the day page.

- Python libraries requests and bs4 are used to find image download links. Selenium webdriver must be used to find video downloads since iFunny.co loads videos dynamically through javascript.

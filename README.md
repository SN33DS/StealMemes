# Project Title

StealMemes is a python script which scrapes meme images and videos from iFunny.co's top memes of the day page.

Python libraries requests and bs4 are used to find image download links. Selenium webdriver must be used to find video downloads since iFunny.co loads videos dynamically through javascript.
